All windows are written in Lastlands GUI Language (LGL).

The ending character of a line is the newline character (like in Python). The commands of LGL are the following:

# [Anything] - Comment (there must be a space after the hashtag)
size px] [y] - Changes the size of the window
element [x] [y] - Creates a generic element at position (x,y). It will appear as "Invalid Element" in game.
position [x] [y] - Sets the position of the window to (x,y). By default it's the center of the screen
title [title] - Sets the title to [title]. Remember to put [title] in quotes if it's more than one word
text [text] [x] [y] [textSize] [red] [green] [blue] - Creates a text element. Remember to put [text] in quotes if it's more than one word
